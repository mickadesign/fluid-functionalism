  { name: "placeholder", type: "string", default: '"Ask me anything…"', description: "Placeholder shown when the value is empty. While a file is being dragged over the component (and attachments are enabled), the placeholder swaps to “Drop files here to add to chat”." },
  { name: "leftSlot", type: "ReactNode | (ctx) => ReactNode", description: "Content rendered in the bottom-left action area. May be a render-fn that receives `{ openFilePicker, files }` — `openFilePicker(acceptOverride?)` opens the native file picker (optionally scoped to a subset of accept types, e.g. `\"image/*\"`)." },
  { name: "rightSlot", type: "ReactNode | (ctx) => ReactNode", description: "Content rendered in the bottom-right action area, before the built-in send button. Same render-fn shape as `leftSlot`." },

  { name: "files", type: "File[]", description: "Controlled list of attached files. Pair with `onFilesChange` to enable drag-and-drop and the file-picker slot helper. When omitted, attachment behavior is disabled." },
  { name: "onFilesChange", type: "(files: File[]) => void", description: "Called when files are added (drag-drop or picker) or removed via the preview tile’s × button. Duplicate drops of the same file (same name + size + lastModified) are silently de-duplicated." },
  { name: "accept", type: "string", default: '"image/png,image/jpeg,application/pdf"', description: "Accepted MIME types as a comma-separated string. Used by both the file picker and the drag-and-drop filter." },
  { name: "maxFiles", type: "number", description: "Maximum number of attached files. Extra files beyond this limit are dropped." },
  { name: "filePreviewSize", type: "number", default: "80", description: "Side length (in pixels) of each preview tile. Images use object-cover; PDFs render the first page via pdfjs; other types fall back to a centered icon. A theme-aware inset outline keeps light media edges visible." },
  { name: "textareaProps", type: "TextareaHTMLAttributes", description: "Extra props forwarded to the underlying textarea (value, onChange, onKeyDown, disabled and placeholder are controlled by the component)." },
  { name: "status", type: '"idle" | "streaming"', description: "Assistant response state. When \"streaming\", the send button becomes a Stop control (empty draft) or a Queue action (non-empty draft). On the streaming→idle edge the next queued message auto-dispatches via onSend. Leave undefined for the legacy send-immediately behavior." },
  { name: "onStop", type: "() => void", description: "Fires when the Stop control is pressed (streaming + empty draft). Halt the current response and set status to \"idle\" — that edge immediately dispatches the next queued message." },
  { name: "queue", type: "QueuedMessage[]", description: "Controlled queue of pending messages, rendered as reorderable rows above the textarea. Double-click (or Enter/F2) edits a row back into the composer; the × (or Delete) removes it; drag — or Alt+↑/↓ — reorders. Requires status to be controlled." },
  { name: "onQueueChange", type: "(queue: QueuedMessage[]) => void", description: "Called whenever the queue changes — enqueue, edit, delete, reorder, or auto-dispatch. Each QueuedMessage is { id, text, files }." },
  { name: "showQueue", type: "boolean", default: "true", description: "Render the built-in reorderable queue rows above the textarea. Set to false to suppress them and render the queue yourself (e.g. as full-width rows above the composer) — enqueue and auto-dispatch still run." },
  { name: "history", type: "string[]", default: "[]", description: "Previously-sent messages, oldest first. With the textarea focused, ArrowUp (caret on the first line) recalls the previous message and walks backward; ArrowDown (caret on the last line) walks forward toward the in-progress draft. Editing or sending exits history mode." },
  { name: "placeholderSuggestion", type: "string", description: "Suggested prompt rendered as the placeholder (with a Tab keycap) while the draft is empty. Pressing Tab fills it into the composer — it doesn't send. Takes precedence over placeholder. Shift+Tab still moves focus backward, and once the draft is non-empty Tab resumes normal focus traversal." },
  { name: "suggestions", type: "string[]", description: "Suggested prompts listed under the action bar while the draft is empty. ArrowDown moves a highlight into the list (focus stays in the textarea, tracked via aria-activedescendant), ArrowUp walks back up and out, Enter or click fills the highlighted prompt into the composer. Escape drops the highlight; typing collapses the list. While nothing is highlighted the first row shows a ↓ hint in the slot where the highlighted row shows ↵." },
